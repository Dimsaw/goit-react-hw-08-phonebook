    <h4>
      Serif fonts refer to fonts that have small decorative flourishes at the
      end of strokes. In some situations, serif fonts are also referred to as
      “Roman”. The most common serif font is Times New Roman. It is said that
      serifs make the individual letters more distinctive and our brain can
      spend less time on recognizing letters so Serif fonts are considered to be
      easier to read on printed material such as books and newspapers, where
      they are used most. However, things may be different for the web. Since
      computer screen has a much lower resolution than printed works like books
      and newspapers, serif fonts can make the letters pixilated and hard to
      read. Hence, for online publishing, sans serif fonts are usually
      preferred. Tabac designed by Suitcase Type Foundry is a typical serif font
      family. It is a static typeface with modern shapes and distinct, wedge
      shaped serifs and it is mainly designed for the setting of newspapers,
      magazines and books.
